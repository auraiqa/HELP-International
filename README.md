This project was completed as part of the **SanberCode Bootcamp** final project. Although this is just a simplified case study, it helped me understand how data can be used to support high-impact decisions in real-world nonprofit settings.

The analysis and recommendation approach are open for improvement — and I’d love to hear your feedback!
